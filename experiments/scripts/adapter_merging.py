    Sliding-window selection and weighting for models numbered 2..12 (inclusive).

    Args:
        target_grade: center of the window; accepts int 2..12 or zero-padded str like "02".
        window_size: how many grades to include on each side of the target (>= 0).
        weight_method:
            - "uniform": every selected adapter weight == 1, by definition.
            - "proximity": weights decrease with absolute distance to target and
              are normalized so the average weight across the selection equals 1.

    Returns:
        (selected_grades, weights), where:
            - selected_grades is an ascending list of ints within [2, 12], clipped at bounds.
            - weights has the same length as selected_grades.

    Behavior notes:
        - The window always centers on target, then clips at 2 and 12 as needed.
        - For "proximity", raw weights use an inverse-distance profile: 1 / (1 + |g - target|).
          We then scale so that mean(weight) == 1 (i.e., sum == len(selection)).
